                  <p>Risk is the intentional interaction with uncertainty. Humans by nature do not like uncertainty. We like to know how what to expect. This quote from Heath Ledger&rsquo;s portrayal of the Joker is telling “Nobody panics when things go “according to plan”. Even if the plan is horrifying!”. So we love order even if it is bad events that are in order.</p>

<p>So why is <em>Risk</em> our <em>Friend</em>?</p>

<p>Risk is the interaction with uncertainty and if we can handle even a little bit of uncertainty we can be certain we are doing the right thing. It sounds contradictory but for somethings one can know everything or almost everything that could happen. For instance, no matter how many times you roll a die you&rsquo;ll never get a cheeseburger. You&rsquo;ll always get 1-6, that&rsquo;s it. So there may be uncertainty yes but we can be certain that the outcome won&rsquo;t surprise us. For instance, we can invest in the stock market and understand there is risk of losing 50% of our portfolio at any given time. If we plan ahead then taking this risk isn&rsquo;t all that difficult, while still reaping a much greater reward in the long run.</p>

<p><em>Risk</em> is an advantage.</p>

<p>My uncle told me to max my 401k, and IRAs and to save as much as possible. He mentioned that he reached FI at a young age. What this did for him was allow him to take huge career risks. He told me he took a risk at his career, if it worked out he&rsquo;d be hugely rewarded, if not it would likely end his career and he&rsquo;d find other things to do. No other co-workers would even dream of taking the risks that he did because they had more to lose. So when it comes to taking risks or investing there is always an upside but the focus should be on reducing the downside which is where we find our advantage. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re wondering what ever happened, did his risky career move pay off? I think the answer shouldn&rsquo;t matter. He made a smart investment decision and he would repeatedly take those decisions and eventually they would pay off. If you must know, yes, he was hugely rewarded for his effort and continues to work in his very rewarding career decades after reaching financial independence.</p>

<p><em>Failure is okay.</em></p>

<p>Have you ever failed a class in school? Received an incomplete or straight up &lsquo;F&rsquo;? I have, both in high school and college. I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m proud of it and there were other circumstance of why I failed but none-the-less I failed. Failure is okay. I graduated high school at the age of 19, I only had a 3.0 GPA in college and less than that for high school. I&rsquo;ve lost more money (and won) than I care to divulge. Yet, despite all of those things  here I am planning on being FI by my early 30&rsquo;s. The reason being is that I&rsquo;m okay with failure and I have made failure cheap. When I fail the downside is always much lower than the upside. I never fail to deeply that I cannot recover to try again.</p>

<p><em>The Greatest Risk is not being able to try again</em></p>

<p>Imagine you start a business. Imagine that business fails. The business cost you 2 months worth of savings. This is a cheap failure. You can wait another 2 months and try again at the same thing or try something new. Now if you had invested 100% of all your money and taken a second mortgage on your house then failure would have left you in a position that you couldn&rsquo;t try again. This is related to <a href="http://www.bettingonsuccess.com/post/diversification" title="Diversification">Diversification</a>, something we&rsquo;ll discuss later.</p>
