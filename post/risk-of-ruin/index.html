                  <p>This blog is titled <em>Betting On Success</em>, so you might think I am focusing on the success, which I am but I also give due importance (but no more mind you) to failure. I focus on success because humans are naturally <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/07/hidden-danger-of-being-risk-averse" title="hidden danger of being risk averse">overly risk adverse</a> and tend to weight loses twice as much as wins.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Risk aversion</strong>Â is a preference for a sure outcome over a gamble with higher or equal expected value.&rdquo; -Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My wife and I personally save a large portion of our income. We save as much as we can, and we always have even if it was only $20 / month. We do this in order to reduce our chance of losing what we have. If our car breaks down, we have enough cash to by a different car for cash, even if it is 10 years old, I then don&rsquo;t have to worry about losing my job just because I don&rsquo;t have a car to get to work. This cash buffer allows me to pursue better job opportunities that have a positive <a href="http://bettingonsuccess.com/post/expected-value/" title="Expected Value">Expected Value</a> while also being able to survive if the worst happens, I&rsquo;ve reduce my Risk of Ruin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Risk of Ruin</strong> is a concept in gambling, insurance, and finance relating to the likelihood of losing all one&rsquo;s investment capital&rdquo; -Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If say you make a bet on a coin toss. Heads you win $1.25 and Tails you lose $1. This is a positive EV situation BUT what if you only have 5 dollars? You only need to lose early on to completely wipe out your bankroll. This is why Risk of Ruin is critical. You may be making a <strong>good</strong> bet BUT that bet will <strong>RUIN</strong> you over 50% of the time, sound like the definition of a bad gamble; the odds are not in your favor.</p>

<p>Back to my more practical example of switching jobs. I actually did this. I moved to a smaller company for more pay. This was more or less a startup company that had a risk of laying me off. I didn&rsquo;t expect (mathematically) to get laid off but my intelligent wife reminded me it <em>could</em> happen. So I had to weigh that option. <em>If</em> I got laid off what would happen? Well we have money saved that we could pay all of our bills, we wouldn&rsquo;t lose our home, or go hungry. I&rsquo;d have ample time to look for a new job. This is an example, I find most good bets are like this too, of where the Advantage isn&rsquo;t made by increase your upside but reducing your downside.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Profit</strong> is often easier to achieve by reducing our downside than our upside, which in turn allows us to take more risk, increasing our upside - Mr. BoS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A good example is Travel Hacking / Credit Card hacking. A credit card offers you $100 CASH if you get their card and spend $500 in the first 3 months. That&rsquo;s a great deal! But wait <em>why</em>? They hide YOUR downside because that is THEIR upside. The downside is that you overspend and they make a % on all the money you charge PLUS 18% interest on any balance you carry. Now there is no way to increase the $100 bonus BUT you can reduce your downside. You can <strong>only</strong> use the card for regular expenses and pay it off on time. You pay no interest, you don&rsquo;t spend extra money and you still get the $100. In personal finance I find that often the best place to start is reducing the downside, your expenses and THEN increasing your upside which ultimately your advantage is the ratio of your upside to your downside.</p>

<p>Here is a simple income example of someone making some great money.</p>

<p>Income: $100k</p>

<p>Expenses: $90k</p>

<p>They save 10% of their money or $10k. Now what if they want to save 25% of their income?</p>

<ol>
<li>Increase their income to $120k</li>
<li>Decrease their expenses to $75k</li>
</ol>

<p>They can increase their income by 20% or reduce their expenses by 17%. If they are the same effort then the expenses is easier. BUT there is a thing called taxes so increase the income by $20k might only increase their net take home pay by $14k. They may need to get a $26k gross increase, working that much harder or longer to achieve the same thing. Obviously this isn&rsquo;t ALWAYS true, few things in life are absolutes. It can take little effort to find cheaper car insurance, meal prep or buy older vehicles which cost effort up front but can payoff more than overtime or picking up another job.</p>

<p>So what is RUIN for you? If you failed what does that look like? Here are a few life situations.</p>

<ul>
<li>You lose your job</li>
<li>The stock market crashes 50%</li>
<li>You fail a class</li>
<li></li>
