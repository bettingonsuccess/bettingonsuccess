                  <p>I&rsquo;ve well versed in most areas of personal finance, at least what pertains to me. Many, especially in the US, need to be saving a lot more $ instead of constantly going into debt to get a car that costs more than their annual salary or the newest IPhone that costs more than their monthly salary.</p>

<p>For those of us that save and are responsible with money, we may ask why others don&rsquo;t save when a $500 emergency could end them? Well a part of it is that in America if you don&rsquo;t have money, then it is FREE. This may come as controversial and a bit political. I apologize but it needs to be said.</p>

<p>&ndash; If you don&rsquo;t have $ for children there is WIC</p>

<p>&ndash; If you don&rsquo;t have money for nursing home it is FREE. If you have money they&rsquo;ll take it (your home, assets etc) until you are broke. So having $50k saved is punished and having $0 saved is not.</p>

<p>&ndash; Plenty live off of welfare and social security. I&rsquo;ve seen people get $2,000-$3,000 / month in benefits. Free housing, free food from foodshelf etc. Even if they get a job why would they? Their $150 rent would go up to $1200 (like the rest of us pay) AND they&rsquo;d have to actually, um, work.</p>

<p>&ndash; Bankruptcy. I know of people who go bankrupt every 7 years like clockwork. They spend more than they can earn and when it is too much their debts get wiped away. I have a family member that did 10&rsquo;s of $1,000&rsquo;s of dollars of work as a contractor to a home. The owner ended up going bankrupt. In bankruptcy, chapter 7, all your debts are wiped away and you can keep 1 car and your house. So they kept the house, with all the work they did and paid them nothing! It was legal robbery, because they couldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;afford&rsquo; the debt they incurred buying more than they could afford (again people do go bankrupt due to sad and horrible reasons like medical bills. A reason to be well insured and another point that we need to fix our healthcare / insurance in the US already).</p>

<p>&ndash; Force Family. In some states parents can force their children to take care of them in old age. It sounds like in most places this isn&rsquo;t enforced as much but still something that is completely unfair that can happen.</p>

<p>&ndash; Spousal support. This loophole I believe is getting fixed. Imagine a couple divorces and the man was the main breadwinner (this is common and not sexist.). The woman would get spousal maintenance to help her until she remarries or possibly forever. If she co-habitates but doesn&rsquo;t remarry. She can suck off of her ex-husband forever. Plus she can collect her new husband or ex-husband&rsquo;s social security at retirement.</p>

<p>There are so many cases in the US that you can just live off of charity, the government or other people&rsquo;s kindness. I&rsquo;ve tried to help many people myself but have always gotten burned. Often I hear that from very religious people that &lsquo;God&rsquo; will provide, more often than not it is the &lsquo;Gov&rsquo; that provides and not &lsquo;God&rsquo;, one little letter they missed. Some lady spent all hear money on lottery tickets and lost so she started a GoFundMe to help her. This is an extreme example but shows it.</p>

<p>So for those saving to retire comfortably or even early why worry about running out? If you run out there will always be someone who is working hard to pay taxes that will support you.</p>
