      <description>Fall 2016 my wife and I bought our forever home. This is a major life goal for us. This is where we want to stay essentially forever. We will travel all around the world but at the end always end up home. A large part of why we picked our specific home is that it gives us numerous activities to do once we are Financially Independent and have children. We could have easily stayed in our fix and flip house longer or bought a home for half the price; This home was worth it.</description>

      <title>Quit My Job and Failed</title>

      <description>My first post was about going ALL-IN and taking risks to achieve my dreams. Naturally, I assumed that meant going extreme and quitting my job, which I did the day of that post. What followed was quite unexpected; my job wouldn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;lsquo;let&amp;rsquo; me quit. Obviously they couldn&amp;rsquo;t literally keep me from quitting but they did everything that could to keep me from doing so. Frankly, I was shocked. I really do like the company and the direction they are going in.</description>

      <description>Today I took my first step towards achieving my dreams, I quit my job! This has been a plan of mine for a long time and I have multiple contingency plans (oh sh#! plans) in place. I am able to leave a high paying stable IT job because I have been saving a large percentage of my income regularly. This money gives me the ability to leave a bad situation or pursue a better one without having to worry about paying the bills.</description>
