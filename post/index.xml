      <description>My first post was about going ALL-IN and taking risks to achieve my dreams. Naturally, I assumed that meant going extreme and quitting my job, which I did the day of that post. What followed was quite unexpected; my job wouldn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;lsquo;let&amp;rsquo; me quit. Obviously they couldn&amp;rsquo;t literally keep me from quitting but they did everything that could to keep me from doing so. Frankly, I was shocked. I really do like the company and the direction they are going in.</description>

      <description>Today I took my first step towards achieving my dreams, I quit my job! This has been a plan of mine for a long time and I have multiple contingency plans (oh sh#! plans) in place. I am able to leave a high paying stable IT job because I have been saving a large percentage of my income regularly. This money gives me the ability to leave a bad situation or pursue a better one without having to worry about paying the bills.</description>
