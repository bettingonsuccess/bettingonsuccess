                  <p>Being tax season I thought it would be fitting to discuss a heavy but important subject that I haven&rsquo;t seen discussed in the FIRE community or much at all online though ironically in the professional gambling world it has. I want to frame it in the context of FIRE.</p>

<p>Investing vs Gambling. What is the difference? Say you&rsquo;re sitting at the dinner table with family and you say &ldquo;I just bought a share of Microsoft&rsquo;s stock last year, I sold it and made $200&rdquo;. I would think in general it would be taken positively. You&rsquo;re saving money and trying to make more, right?</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s take it a slightly different direction. Again you&rsquo;re sitting at the dinner table with family and you say &ldquo;I just went to the casino and made $200&rdquo;. I would think, in general, it would be taken negatively. You&rsquo;re gambling money and trying to make more, and you did, right?</p>

<p>As we try to achieve FI we need to invest. Since investing will allow us to gain more money, especially via compounding and more importantly investing is how the [<em>Magical Money Making Machine](</em><a href="https://fi180.com/2017/06/26/the-milestones-of-fi/">https://fi180.com/2017/06/26/the-milestones-of-fi/</a> &ldquo;Machine Money Making Machine&rdquo;) works. Also, we need to understand <em>risk</em> since investing is risky as well.</p>

<p>What is <em>Risk</em>?</p>

<p>The act of exposing capital to the possibility of loss.</p>

<p>This definition obviously applies to both <em>Investing</em> and <em>Gambling</em>.</p>

<p>What is <em>Investing</em>?</p>

<p>The act of risking money with the expectation of achieving a profit</p>

<p>What is Gambling?</p>

<p>The act of risking money with the hope of achieving a profit.</p>

<p>AH! Now that we know what risk means we can see that there is ONLY a one little word difference. I&rsquo;ll admit these are my definitions.</p>

<p>Now we are at <em>Expectation</em> vs <em>Hope</em>. Now Hope is pretty straight forward and it is just wishful thinking which when falling from a plane without a parachute, hope, isn&rsquo;t what you need, the parachute is. The trickier word is <em>Expectation</em>.</p>

<p>Hope - The desire for a positive outcome even if the odds are against you.</p>

<p>[Statistical] Expectation - The mathematical (statistical) favorable probability of a positive outcome.</p>

<p>Put simply the difference is if the odds are in your favor. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll always win when you are investing but over the long run you have an <em>advantage.</em></p>

<p>Now I moonlight as a professional gambling. I take cash and I go to the casino and play games that for 99.99% of players is gambling because the house has a mathematical advantage. Now I find a way to exploit the rules of the game to gain an advantage and make money. The term for this is <em>advantage player</em>. It is like comparing someone using credit cards to overspend and pay tons of interest versus someone who uses them strategically to gain valuable points for free flights and hotel stays.</p>

<p>As Brand from the [ChooseFI](<a href="https://www.choosefi.com">https://www.choosefi.com</a>) podcast would say it is about &ldquo;thinking a little bit differently&rdquo;.</p>
