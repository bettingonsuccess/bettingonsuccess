      <description>This post has been a long time going and much overdue, it has almost been 12 months since publishing the follow up to my previous post Why I Chose Hugo Over Wordpress.

      <description>I am finally back with my blog, sorry it has been quite awhile. I just recently finished a migration of my blog my running on Wordpress, which was hosted on WPEngine and is a really awesome service, to Github pages. I got tired of using Wordpress and WPEngine cost me about $30/month&amp;hellip; So I decided to migrate the site to Github pages where I can run the site for free.</description>
