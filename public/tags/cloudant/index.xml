      <description>Part 2: Configuring the Raspberry Pi This is a continuation of Part 1 of Controlling home devices with Bluemix Internet Of Things If you haven’t read Part 1, please do that first…
In Part 1 we got the electrical work out of the way. We wired up the relay’s and connected the circuit’s. In this part of the 3 part series we will configure the Raspberry Pi to control the relay’s that we wired up in part 1.</description>

      <description>The number of Internet connected devices is growing dramatically, it is expected to increase from 15 billon devices in 2015 to 40 billion devices in 2020. These devices make up something called the Internet of Things. These devices can be controlled remotely and interconnected.
While a lot of these devices can be connected to the Internet, most of them are &amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; devices right now. To turn these &amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; devices into smart devices you can use the Internet of Things to connect them to the cloud.</description>

      <description>Hey Yall!
We are back at it again with some demos!!!
Did you ever wonder if you and your favorite celebrity would be compatible if you met?? I sure do! Or did you ever wonder how you could become a better leader, I sure do. Today you would have to go Google the person and analyze posts and articles about them and be a personality expert to see if you have personality traits in common.</description>

      <description>Hey Y’all!
Jeff here again and something I am really excited about is Watson is now available for anyone to use in Bluemix!
Today we are going to be building an example app using Java, Cloudant, and Watson.
Ok let’s talk through what this app is going to do before we build it.
Meet Ivy (hello!)
She’s a talent manager at a growing tech startup.
She’s looking for a new hire that would be a good fit on her team but the company is so popular that she has a huge inventory of resumes to sort through.</description>
