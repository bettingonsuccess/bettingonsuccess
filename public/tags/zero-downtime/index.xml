      <description>I recently wrote a blog post on what a zero downtime deployment is, why it is important, and how to perform one. I am now posting a video on the same topic so you can learn about a zero downtime deployment by watching a video instead.
 If you prefer the tutorial and text instructions please check out Zero Downtime Deployment with the CF Autopilot Plugin.
I would love to hear your feedback and any suggestions you have, please reach out to me on Twitter @jsloyer</description>

      <description>Zero down time deployments are a must for any Internet app running at scale. Without the use of zero down time deployments, you would have to take down your application even just for a fraction of a second but in that fraction of a second you could lose a transaction or a purchase from a customer. This is not acceptable anymore. Some people like to call these apps cloud based apps, which I think is fine, but Iâ€™d rather call them Internet scale or born on the cloud apps.</description>
