      <description>Meteor is a pretty powerful and cool framework for developing modern webapps all in Javascript. It provides some really cool things as a modern UI, responsive code that works on a desktop and a mobile device, and some really slick features with websockets with client and server side rendering.
I heard about Meteor mid-2014 but it peaked my interest last week when I was at a customer and a developer at the customer was building a Meteor app and they were asking how to run it on Bluemix.</description>

      <description>Monolith apps are no more. The age of the monolith is over. It wasnâ€™t that long ago that companies and developers (myself included) were deploying one giant app that did everything. The app would serve all your static files, front-end HTML and CSS and Javascript, act as your REST API, serve as your data persistance tier, handles sessions, handle logins, and do security for your app. The list could keep going on and on.</description>
