      <description>Fall 2016 my wife and I bought our forever home. This is a major life goal for us. This is where we want to stay essentially forever. We will travel all around the world but at the end always end up home. A large part of why we picked our specific home is that it gives us numerous activities to do once we are Financially Independent and have children. We could have easily stayed in our fix and flip house longer or bought a home for half the price; This home was worth it.</description>
