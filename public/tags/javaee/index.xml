      <description>Backed by popular demand this is a continuation of the post Building a Java EE app on IBM Bluemix Using Watson and Cloudant.
This post will detail how to build and deploy the app using IBM DevOps Services.
There is a bit of magic behind this, its called &amp;ldquo;The Deploy to Bluemix Button&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;

      <description>Hey Y’all!
Jeff here again and something I am really excited about is Watson is now available for anyone to use in Bluemix!
Today we are going to be building an example app using Java, Cloudant, and Watson.
Ok let’s talk through what this app is going to do before we build it.
Meet Ivy (hello!)
She’s a talent manager at a growing tech startup.
She’s looking for a new hire that would be a good fit on her team but the company is so popular that she has a huge inventory of resumes to sort through.</description>
