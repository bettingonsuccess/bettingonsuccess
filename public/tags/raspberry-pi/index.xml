      <description>This is an extension/continuation from the blog post on how to create a basic Python webapp. In this tutorial we are going to go through how to integrate a Python Flask webapp in Bluemix with the Internet of Things Foundation in Bluemix with a Raspberry Pi and two sensors on the Raspberry Pi. The tutorial also uses Twilio to interact with the Raspberry Pi.
So what does this look like?</description>

      <description>Part 2: Configuring the Raspberry Pi This is a continuation of Part 1 of Controlling home devices with Bluemix Internet Of Things If you haven’t read Part 1, please do that first…
In Part 1 we got the electrical work out of the way. We wired up the relay’s and connected the circuit’s. In this part of the 3 part series we will configure the Raspberry Pi to control the relay’s that we wired up in part 1.</description>

      <description>The number of Internet connected devices is growing dramatically, it is expected to increase from 15 billon devices in 2015 to 40 billion devices in 2020. These devices make up something called the Internet of Things. These devices can be controlled remotely and interconnected.
While a lot of these devices can be connected to the Internet, most of them are &amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; devices right now. To turn these &amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; devices into smart devices you can use the Internet of Things to connect them to the cloud.</description>
