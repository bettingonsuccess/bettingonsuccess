      <description>With the recent shooting in South Carolina in reminds us that criminal&amp;rsquo;s can and will continue to harm people. They seem like random acts to most of us but to a criminal the acts make sense to them? No one can answer this question except the criminal. To peer inside a criminal&amp;rsquo;s would be next to impossible but what if there existed another way to peer inside their mind&amp;rsquo;s? This could be used to try to identify patterns or personality traits that exist.</description>

      <description>As announced yesterday, IBM has formed a partnership with Box.com, a partnership that includes the integration of Box into the Bluemix catalog. With its REST-based Content and View APIs, embedding enterprise-grade file storage into your app and enabling file sharing among your users has never been simpler.
To help you on your way to becoming a file-sharing guru, Bluemix developer advocate Jake Peyser and I have built a sample app that you can leverage as you begin to explore the possibilities of the Box.</description>

      <description>Part 2: Configuring the Raspberry Pi This is a continuation of Part 1 of Controlling home devices with Bluemix Internet Of Things If you haven’t read Part 1, please do that first…
In Part 1 we got the electrical work out of the way. We wired up the relay’s and connected the circuit’s. In this part of the 3 part series we will configure the Raspberry Pi to control the relay’s that we wired up in part 1.</description>

      <description>The number of Internet connected devices is growing dramatically, it is expected to increase from 15 billon devices in 2015 to 40 billion devices in 2020. These devices make up something called the Internet of Things. These devices can be controlled remotely and interconnected.
While a lot of these devices can be connected to the Internet, most of them are &amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; devices right now. To turn these &amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; devices into smart devices you can use the Internet of Things to connect them to the cloud.</description>

      <title>How Watson and Bluemix see the State of the Union</title>

      <description>The State of the Union, a live broadcast that many Americans historically use as a tool to form opinions about the current political system, and gain insight from their Commander in Chief into the transparency of a system of checks and balances. What is more interesting is the thoughts and underlying feelings between the State of the Union. If we could figure out how the President is feeling or portraying himself, could we infer how the President will schedule and work with legislation and policy for the rest of the year?</description>

      <title>Microservices in Bluemix</title>

      <description>Monolith apps are no more. The age of the monolith is over. It wasn’t that long ago that companies and developers (myself included) were deploying one giant app that did everything. The app would serve all your static files, front-end HTML and CSS and Javascript, act as your REST API, serve as your data persistance tier, handles sessions, handle logins, and do security for your app. The list could keep going on and on.</description>

      <description>Hey Yall!
We are back at it again with some demos!!!
Did you ever wonder if you and your favorite celebrity would be compatible if you met?? I sure do! Or did you ever wonder how you could become a better leader, I sure do. Today you would have to go Google the person and analyze posts and articles about them and be a personality expert to see if you have personality traits in common.</description>

      <title>Inbound Ssl in Bluemix</title>

      <description>Did you know in Bluemix you get inbound SSL for free? It is automatically turned on and enabled for every app. All you have to do is just access your app over https instead of http.
Developers don’t need to implement SSL in their app, you just need to support HTTP and the Bluemix infrastructure will support HTTPS for you and do SSL offloading.
Additionally Bluemix supports the x-forwarded-proto header to allow developers to check with protocol requests are coming in over.</description>

      <title>Kraken.Js and Bluemix</title>

      <description>Kraken.JS is a new wonderful framework wrapper around Express for Node.JS. It includes things such as pre-canned security settings, templating, and internationalization. While Express in Node allows you to customize these type of things its not the most fun thing or exciting thing to do. While security is very important in your app why should you have to write redundant code for this. The answer is you do not have to anymore.</description>
