                  <p>What would you rather have? Your dream house complete with an indoor pool or your dream life full of time, experiences, and having enough money to travel? For me I recently came to a cross-roads where we (wife and I) had to answer that exact question.</p>

<p>You see in America we are taught that if we work hard that we&rsquo;ll achieve the American dream. Big house, fancy car, six-figure job. I have all 3 of those and yet my wife and I wanted something more. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love my life but the &lsquo;American Dream&rsquo; often more accurately translates to Big Mortgage, Big Car Payment, sixty hour job.</p>

<p>I love my job in IT and even though we live in a rich neighborhood I still drive my 2001 Monte Carlo that I bought for $5,000 back in college. of the 3 American dream criteria we did achieve the dream home. We bought a house and lived in it for two years to avoid capital gains tax, especially doing a live in fix and flip. It is currently rented actually even though that wasn&rsquo;t the original plan. So after the 2 years was up we found our dream house. When I say dream home I don&rsquo;t mean cute house on a cul-de-sac, though that too. I mean a 5,000 sq 6 bed 3 bath immaculate home with hard wood floors, granite counter top kitchen (upstairs kitchen) and a complete second kitchen, furnace, fireplace and laundry downstairs as well. Oh did I mention the <strong>indoor</strong> pool, hot tub AND sauna? Oh has 150&rsquo; of shoreline, almost an acre yard to run around in, easy access for fishing and canoeing. Also <em>right</em> on a biking / walking trail that I love taking. What more could a person want, right? <strong><em>right</em></strong>??</p>

<p>Well I wanted more out of life than that <em>really</em> expensive fancy file of sticks. I found the FIRE community through Mr. Money Mustache at the age of 21. What inspired me was his Why of FI. Him and his wife wanted to be full-time parents. We value family more than anything. We&rsquo;ve been saving 50% of our income since then but even as my income went up we spent more so keeping to the 50%. It&rsquo;s a great savings rate but as we increased our costs we worked harder to increase our income, and we did. The thing is we were working so so hard for that fancy pile of sticks (gotta trademark that) that we didn&rsquo;t even get to go fishing much, sure we used the pool but mainly the hot tub. We never used the basement at all and mowing the lawn with a push mower was getting tiring. So one day (last week) while looking at a small house in our area that I thought would work for the renters that weren&rsquo;t able to rent our basement my wife made a comment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d live there. What to we <em>need</em> really? It has 4 bedrooms, a kitchen, 2 bathrooms and a 1 car garage&rdquo;. I agreed with her wholeheartedly and we have been very vocal about our priorities to family and friends. Suddenly it hit us both and we started discussing actually buying that house and MOVING.</p>

<p>Within the next few months we&rsquo;ll be downsizing and moving just a few miles away (2.5 miles closer to downtown, to my mom, to the parks). We&rsquo;ll be moving from a $ 450,000 house to a $ 94,000 house. That&rsquo;s just the perspective from the money. What well be doing is moving from a lot of <em>debt</em>, <em>work,</em> and <em>stress</em> to a life of our dreams. We will be very very close to being financially independent. So close that I&rsquo;ll easily make enough income for us to live on simply by doing side projects and poker. The pressure will be off. We will have the FREEDOM to DO what we want. I can leave my career anytime, we&rsquo;ll be able to travel more without having to feel burdened by the cost (we still travel hack mind you). We are simply stripping away what costs so much and doesn&rsquo;t matter to what costs so little and does.</p>

<p>So here we come world! Vegas, Mexico, Florida, Israel, Bahamas and more!</p>
