      <description>Most people do not think about backups or want to take the time to set one up or spend the money. Boy is that a mistake&amp;hellip; Most people (myself included) are in that boat and they realize they need to backup their data after its too late and they have lost that precious photo of their baby being born.
There are multiple methods for backing up your data, they range from a thumb drive to remote backup.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted in awhile because I have taken a new role at IBM and helped lead the development of the new IBM Bluemix Container Service that allows you to run managed Kubernetes clusters on IBM.
For a little background, IBM has introduced a managed Kubernetes Service, for more information please read the announce post here.
Cabin is a pretty cool mobile app that lets you manage your Kubernetes cluster through your Android or iPhone.</description>

      <description>Recently at work I have been struggling with building a small/minimized Docker container of a Go app I have been working on. I started with busybox but it has a major short coming&amp;hellip; CA certificates. It isn&amp;rsquo;t trivial to get CA Certs on a busybox container. This problem effectively prevents you from using SSL or TLS with your app&amp;hellip; This is a non-starter&amp;hellip;
Enter Alpine I was doing some reading and I have seen a couple articles mention Alpine, its effectively a slimmed down version of busybox but it makes it trivially easy to install packages, in my case CA Certificates!</description>

      <description>This post has been a long time going and much overdue, it has almost been 12 months since publishing the follow up to my previous post Why I Chose Hugo Over Wordpress. But I am finally going to take the time and explain all the technical parts about how I made this blog work with Hugo.

      <description>I am finally back with my blog, sorry it has been quite awhile. I just recently finished a migration of my blog my running on Wordpress, which was hosted on WPEngine and is a really awesome service, to Github pages. I got tired of using Wordpress and WPEngine cost me about $30/month&amp;hellip; So I decided to migrate the site to Github pages where I can run the site for free.</description>

      <description>Following up from my previous post, Canonical recently dropped support for lucid64 which is Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. This affects Cloud Foundry as lucid64 is the basis for most buildpacks. In Cloud Foundry lucid64 is being phased out for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS which is known as cflinuxfs2 in Cloud Foundry.
Getting stacks in org jbsloyer@us.ibm.com / space dev as jbsloyer@us.ibm.com... OK name description lucid64 Ubuntu 10.04 cflinuxfs2 Ubuntu 14.04.2 trusty  The PHP buildpack will take the default system buildpack and right now in Bluemix it is lucid64.</description>

      <description>With the recent shooting in South Carolina in reminds us that criminal&amp;rsquo;s can and will continue to harm people. They seem like random acts to most of us but to a criminal the acts make sense to them? No one can answer this question except the criminal. To peer inside a criminal&amp;rsquo;s would be next to impossible but what if there existed another way to peer inside their mind&amp;rsquo;s? This could be used to try to identify patterns or personality traits that exist.</description>

      <description>Meteor is a pretty powerful and cool framework for developing modern webapps all in Javascript. It provides some really cool things as a modern UI, responsive code that works on a desktop and a mobile device, and some really slick features with websockets with client and server side rendering.
I heard about Meteor mid-2014 but it peaked my interest last week when I was at a customer and a developer at the customer was building a Meteor app and they were asking how to run it on Bluemix.</description>

      <description>Recently the company that owns development for Ubuntu (Canonical) just announced it is dropping support for lucid 64 which is Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. What does this mean for Cloud Foundry and the community buildpacks?
Well nothing really but there is a couple gotcha&amp;rsquo;s you should know about.
I have seen issues with the following buildpacks, this is not a comprehensive list but the ones I at least know about.

      <description>As announced yesterday, IBM has formed a partnership with Box.com, a partnership that includes the integration of Box into the Bluemix catalog. With its REST-based Content and View APIs, embedding enterprise-grade file storage into your app and enabling file sharing among your users has never been simpler.
To help you on your way to becoming a file-sharing guru, Bluemix developer advocate Jake Peyser and I have built a sample app that you can leverage as you begin to explore the possibilities of the Box.</description>

      <description>Zero down time deployments are a must for any Internet app running at scale. Without the use of zero down time deployments, you would have to take down your application even just for a fraction of a second but in that fraction of a second you could lose a transaction or a purchase from a customer. This is not acceptable anymore. Some people like to call these apps cloud based apps, which I think is fine, but I’d rather call them Internet scale or born on the cloud apps.</description>

      <description>I’m pumped for the Cloud Foundry Summit! Are you??? Well if you aren’t yet hopefully you will be after reading this!
If you attended the conference last year there was an awesome presentation on the future of Diego. What is Diego you ask? It is the new DEA that is coming for Cloud Foundry. It is a complete re-write in Go and will add some new features such as the ability to swap out the underlaying linux containers for things like Docker.</description>

      <description>The number of Internet connected devices is growing dramatically, it is expected to increase from 15 billon devices in 2015 to 40 billion devices in 2020. These devices make up something called the Internet of Things. These devices can be controlled remotely and interconnected.
While a lot of these devices can be connected to the Internet, most of them are &amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; devices right now. To turn these &amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; devices into smart devices you can use the Internet of Things to connect them to the cloud.</description>

      <description>The State of the Union, a live broadcast that many Americans historically use as a tool to form opinions about the current political system, and gain insight from their Commander in Chief into the transparency of a system of checks and balances. What is more interesting is the thoughts and underlying feelings between the State of the Union. If we could figure out how the President is feeling or portraying himself, could we infer how the President will schedule and work with legislation and policy for the rest of the year?</description>

It wasn’t that long ago that companies and developers (myself included) were deploying one giant app that did everything. The app would serve all your static files, front-end HTML and CSS and Javascript, act as your REST API, serve as your data persistance tier, handles sessions, handle logins, and do security for your app. The list could keep going on and on.</description>

      <description>While IBM is rapidly bringing new services and capabilities into Bluemix, one of the reasons our customers are so interested in Bluemix is because they can use our platform and services in conjunction with many other open source and third party APIs and services. The ability to easily access and integrate this combination of technology is one of the biggest values for any developer looking to build applications on Bluemix.</description>

Jeff here again and something I am really excited about is Watson is now available for anyone to use in Bluemix!
Today we are going to be building an example app using Java, Cloudant, and Watson.
Ok let’s talk through what this app is going to do before we build it.
Meet Ivy (hello!)
She’s a talent manager at a growing tech startup.
She’s looking for a new hire that would be a good fit on her team but the company is so popular that she has a huge inventory of resumes to sort through.</description>

      <description>In Cloud Foundry (the open source technology behind Bluemix), when you do a cf push, Cloud Foundry will actually stop your app and restart it with the new code that you just uploaded. This presents an issue for a production app or any app that is actually serving users. There is a shortcoming with the current DEA (the part in Cloud Foundry that runs your app) but the next version of the DEA (Diego) will help address this.</description>

      <description>Did you know in Bluemix you get inbound SSL for free? It is automatically turned on and enabled for every app. All you have to do is just access your app over https instead of http.
Developers don’t need to implement SSL in their app, you just need to support HTTP and the Bluemix infrastructure will support HTTPS for you and do SSL offloading.
Additionally Bluemix supports the x-forwarded-proto header to allow developers to check with protocol requests are coming in over.</description>

      <description>Kraken.JS is a new wonderful framework wrapper around Express for Node.JS. It includes things such as pre-canned security settings, templating, and internationalization. While Express in Node allows you to customize these type of things its not the most fun thing or exciting thing to do. While security is very important in your app why should you have to write redundant code for this. The answer is you do not have to anymore.</description>
