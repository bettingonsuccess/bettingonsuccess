      <description>Recently at work I have been struggling with building a small/minimized Docker container of a Go app I have been working on. I started with busybox but it has a major short coming&amp;hellip; CA certificates. It isn&amp;rsquo;t trivial to get CA Certs on a busybox container. This problem effectively prevents you from using SSL or TLS with your app&amp;hellip; This is a non-starter&amp;hellip;
Enter Alpine I was doing some reading and I have seen a couple articles mention Alpine, its effectively a slimmed down version of busybox but it makes it trivially easy to install packages, in my case CA Certificates!</description>
