      <description>This post has been a long time going and much overdue, it has almost been 12 months since publishing the follow up to my previous post Why I Chose Hugo Over Wordpress.

      <description>I am finally back with my blog, sorry it has been quite awhile. I just recently finished a migration of my blog my running on Wordpress, which was hosted on WPEngine and is a really awesome service, to Github pages. I got tired of using Wordpress and WPEngine cost me about $30/month&amp;hellip; So I decided to migrate the site to Github pages where I can run the site for free.</description>

      <description>Recently the company that owns development for Ubuntu (Canonical) just announced it is dropping support for lucid 64 which is Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. What does this mean for Cloud Foundry and the community buildpacks?
Well nothing really but there is a couple gotcha&amp;rsquo;s you should know about.
I have seen issues with the following buildpacks, this is not a comprehensive list but the ones I at least know about.

      <description>I’m pumped for the Cloud Foundry Summit! Are you??? Well if you aren’t yet hopefully you will be after reading this!
If you attended the conference last year there was an awesome presentation on the future of Diego. What is Diego you ask? It is the new DEA that is coming for Cloud Foundry. It is a complete re-write in Go and will add some new features such as the ability to swap out the underlaying linux containers for things like Docker.</description>
