      <description>I am, currently, a software developer who moonlights as a professional blackjack player.
I am active in the F.I. (Financial Independence) community. I am pursuing Financial Independence, but more importantly pursuing freedom to live the life I want.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been an advantage player (professional gambler) as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been a software engineer. I feel that understanding advantage play has given me an edge in every aspect of life including money, time and energy.</description>
