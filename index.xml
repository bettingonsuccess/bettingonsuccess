      <description>Going All-In Today I took my first step towards achieving my dreams, I quit my job. Quitting my job wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy, especially a lucrative IT job. It was a very stressful, demanding position that ultimately was keeping me from being able to fully realize my dreams.
I was able to drop my job because I have a large amount saved and have multiple income streams producing cash flow. The cash and cash flow cushion will give me time to ramp up my side hustle to a whole new level without having to worry about paying the bills.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I can always make more money, I cannot make more time&amp;rdquo;
I am, currently, a software developer who moonlights as a professional gambler.
I am active in the F.I. (Financial Independence) community. I am pursuing Financial Independence, but more importantly pursuing freedom to live the life I want.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been making money as a professional gambler as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been a software engineer. I feel that understanding advantage play has given me an edge in every aspect of life including money, time and energy.</description>
