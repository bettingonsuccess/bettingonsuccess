      <description>Today I took my first step towards achieving my dreams, I quit my job! This has been a plan of mine for a long time and I have multiple contingency plans (oh sh#! plans) in place. I am able to leave a high paying stable IT job because I have been saving a large percentage of my income regularly. This money gives me the ability to leave a bad situation or pursue a better one without having to worry about paying the bills.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I can always make more money, I cannot make more time&amp;rdquo;
I am, currently, a software developer who moonlights as a professional gambler.
I am active in the F.I. (Financial Independence) community. I am pursuing Financial Independence, but more importantly pursuing freedom to live the life I want.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been making money as a professional gambler as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been a software engineer. I feel that understanding advantage play has given me an edge in every aspect of life including money, time and energy.</description>
