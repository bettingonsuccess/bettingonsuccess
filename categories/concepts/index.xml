      <description>As we all know in the FIRE community, FI/RE stands for Financial Independence / Retire Early. I want to be so bold as to attempt to introduce a new acronym into our FIRE vocabulary, WATER.
Putting WATER on FIRE might sound contradictory but if we separate Water, H20, into individual parts we get Hydrogen and Oxygen which burns quite well; I find the same for the WATER acronym.

      <description>This blog is titled Betting On Success, so you might think I am focusing on the success, which I am but I also give due importance (but no more mind you) to failure. I focus on success because humans are naturally overly risk adverse and tend to weight loses twice as much as wins.
 &amp;ldquo;Risk aversionÂ is a preference for a sure outcome over a gamble with higher or equal expected value.</description>
