      <description>Risk is the intentional interaction with uncertainty. Humans by nature do not like uncertainty. We like to know how what to expect. This quote from Heath Ledger&amp;rsquo;s portrayal of the Joker is telling “Nobody panics when things go “according to plan”. Even if the plan is horrifying!”. So we love order even if it is bad events that are in order.
So why is Risk our Friend?
Risk is the interaction with uncertainty and if we can handle even a little bit of uncertainty we can be certain we are doing the right thing.</description>

      <description>Being tax season I thought it would be fitting to discuss a heavy but important subject that I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen discussed in the FIRE community or much at all online though ironically in the professional gambling world it has. I want to frame it in the context of FIRE.
Investing vs Gambling. What is the difference? Say you&amp;rsquo;re sitting at the dinner table with family and you say &amp;ldquo;I just bought a share of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s stock last year, I sold it and made $200&amp;rdquo;.</description>
