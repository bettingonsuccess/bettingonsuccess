      <description>Today I took my first step towards achieving my dreams, I quit my job! This has been a plan of mine for a long time and I have multiple contingency plans (oh sh#! plans) in place. I am able to leave a high paying stable IT job because I have been saving a large percentage of my income regularly. This money gives me the ability to leave a bad situation or pursue a better one without having to worry about paying the bills.</description>
