      <description>Going All-In Today I took my first step towards achieving my dreams, I quit my job. Quitting my job wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy, especially a lucrative IT job. It was a very stressful, demanding position that ultimately was keeping me from being able to fully realize my dreams.
I was able to drop my job because I have a large amount saved and have multiple income streams producing cash flow. The cash and cash flow cushion will give me time to ramp up my side hustle to a whole new level without having to worry about paying the bills.</description>
