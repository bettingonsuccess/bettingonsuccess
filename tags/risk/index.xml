      <description>Today I took my first step towards achieving my dreams, I quit my job! This has been a plan of mine for a long time and I have multiple contingency plans in place. Pursuing my side hustle has been a dream of mine for over 4 years now. I am now finally making it a reality! It is both exciting as well as frightening.
I am able to leave a high paying stable IT job because I have been saving a large percentage of my income regularly.</description>
