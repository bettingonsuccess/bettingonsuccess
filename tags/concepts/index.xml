      <description>This blog is titled Betting On Success, so you might think I am focusing on the success, which I am but I also give due importance (but no more mind you) to failure. I focus on success because humans are naturally overly risk adverse and tend to weight loses twice as much as wins.
 &amp;ldquo;Risk aversionÂ is a preference for a sure outcome over a gamble with higher or equal expected value.</description>
