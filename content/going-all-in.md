# Going All-In

What does 'All-In' mean to you? It means giving 100% of your strength, emotion, effort, time,  wealth and most importantly, faith. When you are _All-In_ there is no turning back. You've proverbially (unless you're in a casino then literally) put all your chips in the circle. 

What I aim to teach on this blog is a health understanding and respect for RISK. What is risk? According to Wikipedia ". . .the intentional interaction with uncertainty". I really, really like this definition. Too often in life we don't want to take risk aka have anything in our lives that is unpredictable. Hey me included. The thing is too often we overly focus on the negative and forget to weight it properly against the upside. The thing with risk is that there is a chance of both success and failure. When we chose the route of inaction or the 'easy' route we often are removing uncertainty but are, at the same time, unintentionally guaranteeing a much more negative outcome than if we had taken the risk and lost.
