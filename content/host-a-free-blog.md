This blog is hosted 100% for free. The optional paid feature I pay for is the domain name which is $12 / year. There is no Bluehost, Hostgator hosting to pay for, or complex wordpress configuration and plugins.

* Github.com
* Forestry.io

Both are free to create an account and use. I'm a software engineer by day so I'm familiar with Github as that is where code shared. In this case your blog will be stored on there and every change will automatically be logged (gotta love version control!).

You'll need to setup Github pages.

Forestry.io 

Create an account

Link Github repo. You'll have to select which branch will be your source and which will be the actual site. I setup _master_, the default branch, to be everything. The actual generated website it builds for me goes into the _master_ branch. Where I write my blog posts in a raw format goes into the aptly named _source_ branch.

Now simply add a _post_, add a title, date, slick image, add some appropriate tags and categories as well as an enticing Description. Then when you're all done writing BOOM hit that beautiful Publish button!
