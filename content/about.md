I am, currently, a software developer who moonlights as a professional gambler.

I am active in the F.I. (Financial Independence) community. I am pursuing Financial Independence, but more importantly pursuing freedom to live the life I want.

I've been making money as a professional gambler as long as I've been a software engineer. I feel that understanding advantage play has given me an edge in every aspect of life including money, time and energy. I want to share the lessons that I have learned and am learning with the world.

\*Disclaimer: I do not nor will I ever encourage the pursuit of gambling as a profession. Those that have gambling problems should seek help. I am not a certified financial planner / advisor and all financial advice is for entertainment purposes only.
