I am currently a software developer by day and a professional blackjack player by nights and weekends.

I am active in the F.I.R.E (Financial Independence / Retire Early) community. I am pursuing Financial Independence, but more importantly pursuing freedom to live the life I want. 

I've been making money as a professional gambler as long as I've been a software engineer. I feel that understanding advantage play has given me an edge in every aspect of life including money, time and energy. I want to share the lessons that I have learned and am learning with the world. 

I hope you'll join me as we discuss how to find more value in all aspects in life, calculate risk and most importantly always Bet On Success.

\*Disclaimer: I do not nor will I ever encourage the pursuit of gambling, either as a profession or otherwise. Those that have gambling problems should seek help. I am not a certified financial planner / adviser and all financial advice is for entertainment purposes only.
