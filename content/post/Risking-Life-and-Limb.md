This is a serious post. Nothing can prepare you for the unknown. Math goes out the window when lives are on the line.

We were given two options by the Doctors.

* Wait: The twins would likely be born at 21 weeks which they'd likely not survive
* Surgery: Not proven to delay birth at all. Risks include bursting the water, twins would _still_ be born early and likely not survive. If it does work they are risks of never having any more children (we don't care about that).

Which would you choose?

We chose to wait. Well until that next night my wife woke up not content with the decision. We discussed it more and we realized that we couldn't afford to wait. Either option was extremely risk and our twins weren't likely going to survive either way. It was best to take the risky option that would give them at least a **chance** to stay in the womb longer. 

We did the surgery.

After what felt like a lifetime the surgeon came out. She told me it went well and that she was recovering.
