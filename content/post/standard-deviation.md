**Standard Deviation**

Welcome back! This month we're describing yet another statistical concept.

So go back to high school and see if you remember what a bell curve is.

If we have a normal distribution of data then 68.2% will fall within one standard deviation.

Variance is the only reason we have Risk of Ruin. Especially for retirement planning where you'll make 8-10% per year, on average. Some years it's -20%, -50% at some points and others up 22%.

The biggest risk is sequence of return risk. I learned this early on with my $3,000 bankroll. I won $10,000 in the first month bringing my bankroll to $13,000. The second month I ended up even (within $50) but within that month at one point I was down $3,000. I'd that had happened first I would have lost my bankroll (not ruined since I could have waited a few months to save up and try again).

This risk is further exaggerated by taking out capital to live on, such as in retirement.

I maybe should have defined this _before_[ Risk of Ruin](http://bettingonsuccess.com/post/risk-of-ruin/ "Risk of Ruin") but this is a bit more maths heavy. These concepts are all very important to understand because they apply to numerous aspects of life. Life isn't nuanced, grayscale, complex and full of ever constantly changing variables and incomplete information.

The is the ever common debate of paying of your mortgage or investing. What many don't understand is the certainty equivalent or how much of a risk premium do you need to take a risk versus a guarantee? Say the market averages 10% not counting inflation. Money Markets are making say 2%. That is a 8% risk premium to take a risk. The main factors are

* Standard Deviation of Investment
* Risk Premium
* Timeline

If you need the money in say 2 years and cannot afford to lose money then the stock market isn't a good idea.

Now for the mortgage example say you have a steady job and you don't mind making mortgage payments. If you're talking about a 30 year time period then hands down investing is almost _always_ the better bet. It isn't guaranteed, that's the point of investing! You get a more guarantee that you'll come out ahead given enough time [law of large numbers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawoflargenumbers.asp "Law of Large numbers").

For the more visual learners out there here is a graph. Time is the X axis (bottom) and imagine your profit is within the red lines on the Y axis. Early on you can be way ABOVE or way BELOW your [expected value](http://bettingonsuccess.com/post/expected-value/ "Expected Value") or average return but as time passes we'll get closer and closer to our average.

Imagine you flip a coin 10 times. The square root of 10 _* 50% * 50% = 1.58._ So 97% of the time we'll be within \~3 of 5 heads or 5 tails. It'd be nothing unusual to see 8 heads and 2 tails within those 10 flips. That's 80% heads when we expected 50%. Now if we flip that same coin 100 times that would require 80 heads. The standard deviation is 5. That would require 6 standard deviations! Getting hit by lightning, bite by a shark and then killed by a soda machine is more likely! We'd be within 10 heads or tails which is merely 10% variation versus the whopping 30% difference we saw with the same frequency with only 10 flips.

1,000 flips = 15.8 standard deviation.

Here's a little comparison

FLIPS      STD DEV     % of FLIPS

10               1.58           15.80%

100              5.00            5.00%

1000          15.81            1.58%

See after 1,000 flips we'll only be within by 4.74 heads (or tails) 99.7% of the time. That's nothing!

The thing is we need to emotionally handle the ride until we get there. As a professional gambler I see 10's of 1,000's of dollars come and go within minutes. My worst run I lost $20,000 in about 30 minutes. Within the next 15 minutes I won back all my money and $8,000 profit. If I had gotten emotional and quit I would have had 0% chance of having that winning streak that brought me my profit. In life, and blackjack, if you can't take the great with the horrible, you won't get the good that is the result of the two. I am investing to get the long run average. I ignore losing streaks as well as lucky runs as well. I'm chasing value and the value is somewhere between the lucky and unlucky times.

Standard Deviation is also what is traditionally describe as _RISK_ with stock investments. If you're investing in index funds then the chance of losing all your money is virtually 0. The main risk then is being able to handle the swings. If you're investing for the long run then ignore it and press on, easier said than done but there isn't anything you need to do or worry about aside from a diversified allocation and then adjust it as you approach retirement.

Once trying to live off that money, that risk is MUCH harder and more complex to handle if you actually need to live off of it. This is why the common advice of having a split between stocks and bonds. Bonds are low risk, low return which reduce volatility or the standard deviation of your total portfolio.

I am fortunate enough to have
