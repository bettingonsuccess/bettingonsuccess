**Standard Deviation**

Welcome back! This month we're describing yet another statistical concept.

So go back to high school and see if you remember what a bell curve is (I don't).

Image of bell curve.

If we have a normal distribution of data then 67% will fall within one standard deviation.

Variance is the only reason we have Risk of Ruin. Especially for retirement planning where you'll make 8-10% per year, on average. Some years it's -20%, -50% at some points and others up 22%. 

The biggest risk is sequence of return risk. I learned this early on with my $3,000 bankroll. I won $10,000 in the first month bringing my bankroll to $13,000. The second month I ended up even (within $50) but within that month at one point I was down $3,000. I'd that had happened first I would have lost my bankroll (not ruined since I could have waited a few months to save up and try again). 

This risk is further exaggerated by taking out capital to live on, such as in retirement.
