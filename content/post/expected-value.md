# Expected Value

This is another important _Definition_ post where we'll define a concept that we can then apply to investing. I will even give examples of how Expected Value or EV can be applied each and every day.

So I think we all understand what _Value_ is. We value $, time, family, or if you're like me in the mornings sleep. Expectation is the act of looking toward the future and planning on something happening. We expect the sun to rise everyday. Expectation is also a statistical term (don't run! Maths aren't scary).

> Expected Value is the Average Actual Value (ROI) that we would receive if we repeated an investment an infinite number of times

So let's say that you take a _risk_ (see previous post to understand that definition better) and apply for a higher position at another company. Now there is a risk that it won't work out at the new company and then you may try to go back to your previous one. The upside is the new company pays a lot more. Is this the right decision to make? There are a lot of variables here so unless you're a brilliant mathematician (statistician specifically) you aren't going to come up with a concrete number. What you're more likely to do is think if the _risk_ will be _rewarded_ accordingly. There are some risks moving companies but the reward outweighs that. That reward isn't guaranteed, nothing in life is except death and taxes; not so sure about the latter. 

Here is a concrete number example. Please answer with your gut feeling. Say we flip a perfectly fair coin. Every time we flip the coin you wager (risk) $1. If the coin lands on _heads_ you win $1.10 (that's profit so I'll give you your $1 wagers plus $1.10). If the coin lands on _tails_ you lose your $1 wagered. Would you take this bet? Does your answer change if we did it 10 or 100 times?
