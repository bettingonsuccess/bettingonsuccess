# Expected Value

This is another important _Definition_ post where we'll define a concept that we can then apply to investing. I will even give examples of how Expected Value or EV can be applied every day.

So I think we all understand what _Value_ is. We value $, time, family, or if you're like me in the mornings sleep. Expectation is the act of looking toward the future and planning on something happening. We expect the sun to rise everyday. Expectation is also a statistical term (don't run! Maths aren't scary).  

> Expected Value is the Average Actual Value (ROI) that we would receive if we repeated an investment an infinite number of times

So let's say that you take a _risk_ (see previous post to understand that definition better) and apply for a higher position at another company. Now there is a risk that it won't work out at the new company and then you may try to go back to your previous one. The upside is the new company pays a lot more. Is this the right decision to make?
