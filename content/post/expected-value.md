# Expected Value

This is another important _Definition_ post where we'll define a concept that we can then apply to investing. I will even give examples of how Expected Value (EV) can be applied each and every day.

So I think we all understand what _Value_ is. We value $, time, family, or if you're like me in the mornings sleep. Expectation is the act of looking toward the future and planning on something happening. We expect the sun to rise everyday. Expectation is also a statistical term (don't run! Maths aren't scary).

> Expected Value is the Average Actual Value (ROI) that we would receive if we repeated an investment an infinite number of times

So let's say that you take a [_risk_](http://www.bettingonsuccess.com/post/risk-is-your-best-friend "Risk") (see previous post to understand that definition better) and apply for a higher position at another company. Now there is a risk that it won't work out at the new company and then you may try to go back to your previous one. The upside is the new company pays a lot more. Is this the right decision to make? There are a lot of variables here so unless you're a brilliant mathematician (statistician specifically) you aren't going to come up with a concrete number. What you're more likely to do is think if the _risk_ will be _rewarded_ accordingly. There are some risks moving companies but the reward outweighs that. That reward isn't guaranteed, nothing in life is except death and taxes; not so sure about the latter.

Here is a concrete number example. Please answer with your gut feeling. Say we flip a perfectly fair coin. Every time we flip the coin you wager (risk) $1. If the coin lands on _heads_ you win $1.10 (that's profit so I'll give you your $1 wagers plus $1.10). If the coin lands on _tails_ you lose your $1 wagered. Would you take this bet? Does your answer change if we did it 10 or 100 times?

The upside has a 50% chance with a return of $1.10. Simple multiplication give the upside EV value (% chance * Return) of $ 0.55. While the downside has a 50% chance as well with a return of -$1.10. EV value of- $.50. Now we take the upside minus the downside (just like Income - Expenses or Assets - Debts). +0.55 -.50 = $0.05 return. We take that return divided by the number of different outcomes, 2 (heads and tails), and we get $0.025. A whopping 2.5 cents. So we can mathematically evaluate that coin flipping opportunity to 2.5 cents profit per flip. That profit mind you isn't guaranteed but that is the EV. In many ways we can treat it as if it were guaranteed 2.5 cents. If you're thinking "sure makes sense but what if I only have $2, I could go broke with a few losses in a row!", well don't get too far ahead of me young padawan. That will be addressed in a post about [_Risk of Ruin_](http://www.bettingonsuccess.com/post/risk-of-ruin "Risk of Ruin") and Monte Carlo simulations.
