What would you rather have? Your dream house complete with an indoor pool or your dream life full of time, experiences, and having enough money to travel? For me I recently came to a cross-roads where I had to answer that exact question.

A year and half ago we found our dream house. When I say dream home I don't mean cute house on a cul-de-sac, though that too. I mean a 5,000 sq 6 bed 3 bath immaculate home with hard wood floors, granite counter top kitchen (upstairs kitchen) and a complete second kitchen, furnace, fireplace and laundry downstairs as well. Oh did I mention the **indoor** pool, hot tub AND sauna? Oh has 150' of shoreline, almost an acre yard to run around in, easy access for fishing and canoeing. Also _right_ on a biking / walking trail that I love taking. What more could a person want, right? **_right_**??
