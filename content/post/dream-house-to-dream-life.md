What would you rather have? Your dream house complete with an indoor pool or your dream life full of time, experiences, and 
having enough money to travel? For me I recently came to a cross-roads and chose the latter.

You see in America we are taught that if we work hard that we'll acheive the American dream. Big house, fancy car, six-figure job. I have all 3 of those and yet my wife and I wanted something more. Don't get me wrong, I love my life but the 'American Dream' often more accurately translates to Big Mortgage, Big Car Payment, sixty hour job.

I've always been a saver. After viewing my parents' struggle with finances that was a major factor into their later divorce. After I got my first job in IT I was making $ 20 / hour (this job was not salary) and working as many hours as I wanted. I was on track to make 50-55k that year thanks to over-time. So even now with my dream house and when I say dream I don't mean cute house on a cul-de-sac, though that too. I mean a 5,000 sq 6 bed 3 bath immaculate home with hard wood floors, granite counter top kitchen (upstairs kitchen) and a complete second kitchen, furnance, fireplace and laundry downstairs as well. Oh did I mention the **indoor** pool, hot tub AND sauna? Oh it is also on the water for easy access for fishing and canoeing.
