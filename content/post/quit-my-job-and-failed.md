My first post was about going ALL-IN and taking risks to achieve my dreams. Naturally, I assumed that meant going extreme and quitting my job, which I did the day of that post. What followed was quite unexpected; my job wouldn't 'let' me quit. Obviously they couldn't literally keep me from quitting but they did everything that could to keep me from doing so. Frankly, I was shocked. I really do like the company and the direction they are going in. I had just doubted that they would let me more or less take 5-10 weeks off for medical issues. They said that was fine and I could work remotely the days that I was available to work.

In the personal finance community there is the concept of FU money or the amount of money needed for you to stay 'FU' (I don't encourage literally doing this) to your employer and being able to survive long enough to find a better opportunity. This is the money I would have used when I was going to leave my employer and rely mainly on my business. Money, even just 3-6 months worth of expenses gives one a large amount of freedom.

So I reconsidered the proposition from my company and my wife to keep BOTH of my loves: software and investing.
