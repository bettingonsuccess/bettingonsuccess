My first post was about going ALL-IN and taking risks to achieve my dreams. Naturally, that meant being extreme and quitting my job, which I did the day of that post. What followed was quite unexpected; my job wouldn't 'let' me quit. Obviously they couldn't literally keep me from quitting. They did ask me if there was anything they could do to help. Frankly, I was shocked. I really do like the company and the direction they are going in but what company would let me go off and more or less take 5-10 weeks off so my wife and I could start a family? I'll be working remotely the majority of the time, but still impressive.

In the personal finance community there is the concept of FU money or the amount of money needed for you to stay 'FU' (I don't encourage literally doing this) to your employer and being able to survive long enough to find a better opportunity. This isn't enough money to last indefinitely but enough for you to keep the lights on and resume normal life until your next opportunity. I've used that FU money or Emergency Fund once myself. I unexpectedly got laid off from a small tech startup (go figure right?) and was able to look for better opportunities without stressing about the bills. It felt great. There was still pressure to find something because I'm not quite FI yet and the time off did reduce my cash position. I had the blessing at that time that my side hustle did very very well and more than made up for my missing income. This is due to having a flexible schedule and a decent upswing. I was logical and knew that I couldn't expect my side hustle to continue to perform at that level, mainly due to my lack of time and resources ($ mainly). Now fast forward almost a year and our savings has grown substantially and I do have enough cash for my side hustle to be full-time. I tried to quit my job and go for it as they say but when my company showed how much they valued me I reconsidered. I enjoy my job in software quite a lot actually. Over the last 2 1/2 years, as a young adult in his 20's I said 'yes' to everything. This was good at the time and allowed me to gain valuable though often difficult experiences that have given me the mindset of someone more in their 30's. When I get Id at a bar I sometimes get a little annoyed, but then I realize I haven't been over 21 all that long, it just feels that way due to so much happening so quickly.

So I reconsidered the proposition from my company and my wife to keep BOTH of my loves: software and  my investing side hustle.
