Being tax season I thought it would be fitting to discuss a heavy but important subject that I haven't seen discussed in the FIRE community or much at all online though ironically in the professional gambling world it has. I want to frame it in the context of FIRE. 

Investing vs Gambling. What is the difference? Say you're sitting at the dinner table with family and you say "I just bought a share of Microsoft's stock last year, I sold it and made $200". I would think in general it would be taken positively. You're saving money and trying to make more, right? 

So, let's take it a slightly different direction. Again you're sitting at the dinner table with family and you say "I just went to the casino and made $200". I would think, in general, it would be taken negatively. You're gambling money and trying to make more, and you did, right?

As we try to achieve FI we need to invest. Since investing will allow us to gain more money, especially via compounding and more importantly investing is how the _Magical Money Making Machine_ works.
