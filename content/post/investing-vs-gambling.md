Being tax season I thought it would be fitting to discuss a heavy but important subject that I haven't seen discussed in the FIRE community or much at all online though ironically in the professional gambling world it has. I want to frame it in the context of FIRE.

Investing vs Gambling. What is the difference? Say you're sitting at the dinner table with family and you say "I just bought a share of Microsoft's stock last year, I sold it and made $200". I would think in general it would be taken positively. You're saving money and trying to make more, right?

So, let's take it a slightly different direction. Again you're sitting at the dinner table with family and you say "I just went to the casino and made $200". I would think, in general, it would be taken negatively. You're gambling money and trying to make more, and you did, right?

As we try to achieve FI we need to invest. Since investing will allow us to gain more money, especially via compounding and more importantly investing is how the \[_Magical Money Making Machine\](_[https://fi180.com/2017/06/26/the-milestones-of-fi/](https://fi180.com/2017/06/26/the-milestones-of-fi/) "Machine Money Making Machine") works. Also, we need to understand _risk_ since investing is risky as well.

What is _Risk_?

The act of exposing capital to the possibility of loss.

This definition obviously applies to both _Investing_ and _Gambling_.

What is _Investing_?

The act of risking money with the expectation of achieving a profit

What is Gambling?

The act of risking money with the hope of achieving a profit.

AH! Now that we know what risk means we can see that there is ONLY a one little word difference. I'll admit these are my definitions. 

Now we are at _Expectation_ vs _Hope_. Now Hope is pretty straight forward and it is just wishful thinking which when falling from a plane without a parachute, hope, isn't what you need, the parachute is. The trickier word is _Expectation_.

Hope - The desire for a positive outcome even if the odds are against you.

\[Statistical\] Expectation - The mathematical (statistical) favorable probability of a positive outcome.

Put simply the difference is if the odds are in your favor. This doesn't mean you'll always win when you are investing but over the long run you have an _advantage._ 

Now I moonlight as a professional gambling. I take cash and I go to the casino and play games that for 99.99% of players is gambling because the house has a mathematical advantage. Now I find a way to exploit the rules of the game to gain an advantage and make money. The term for this is _advantage player_. It is like comparing someone using credit cards to overspend and pay tons of interest versus someone who uses them strategically to gain valuable points for free flights and hotel stays.

As Brad from the \[ChooseFI\](https://www.choosefi.com) podcast would say it is about "thinking a little bit differently".
