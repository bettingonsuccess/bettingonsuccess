Just found out that my wife is pregnant and we are already thinking about opening investment accounts for our child. As someone pursuing FIRE (Financial Independence / Retired Early) I often try to optimize my money which includes how I'll handle my child's finances. I was hoping to setup a trust fund (no, my children will not be trust fund kids) and possibly a 529 plan. Sadly, these options that seem designed to help parents help their kids really don't. 

The wife and I will be FIRE'd for well over a decade by the time our first child might enter college. I have my opinions on hire education and the cost in the US but I'll leave that for another post. I an assume that there is a high probability that they will to go some for of higher education school. I don't want to jeopardize their chances of getting financial aid through the FAFSA.

Here is the plan.

* Save & Invest money on behalf of my children in the _parent's_ names
* Put the money in a _regular brokerage_ account
* When FI I will have little to no income
* The year that my child applies for FAFSA I will ONLY use principle form my ROTH IRA to live on, 1. reducing my income 2. avoiding capital gains tax
* By having less than $50,000 income (retirement contributions made that year do not count) AND having no capital gains tax (schedule D) then the rest of the _parent's_ **re-portable _assets_** _are **ignored**_

**The Big Risk**

This plan is quite easy to pulloff for those pursuing FIRE and planning on being FIRE'd when their children enter post-secondary education. The biggest risk is having capital gains tax (I assume ANY amount would disqualify YIKES!) which means ANY assets held in regular brokerage accounts that pay dividends will make this plan collapse (VTSAX). I plan on having MOST of my assets in retirement accounts which are not required to be reported BUT all the money in regular brokerage accounts I will have to the year before _sell_ and _buy_ assets that produce no dividends (BRK.B is well diversified and Buffet has never pays dividends).
