Failure is hard, accepting failure is harder, worse yet is choosing to surrender. Too often I find myself working too hard to just avoid failure, when avoiding or delaying the inevitable often exacerbates the problem(s) I'm facing. I don't want to fail because by definition the successful don't fail right? Surrendering is choosing to fail and accepting one's limitations. It is a choice to let go of pride, to accept that one is in a bad situation and cannot take even a single step more in that direction. 

Surrender is a term in Blackjack where you give up half your bet. It sounds like a bad deal but if you have a 16 vs a dealer's face you'll lose that hand 72% of the time. Surrendering actually saves you 22%. So failing to chose to fail makes one fail even more.

For me lately, we've been struggling with our rental property. It is quite emotional as it is the house I grew up in, a lot of bad memories reside there. We had turmoil when renting to family for a short period of time, then recently evicted the last tenant. We've been working very hard, time and money, to get the house ready to sell by July. I don't know if the house will be profitable or how much if it is. I know the ROI on my effort and emotion has been negative. There is a lot to be said about keeping things simple. My following post will be about [_Doubling Down_](www.bettingonsuccess.com/post/doubling-down/ "Doubling Down") since after _surrendering_ the things that are holing me down, I need to then take the energy I put in those unfruitful endeavors and put that into the ones that have brought me money, joy and benefit.
