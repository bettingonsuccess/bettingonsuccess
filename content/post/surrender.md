Failure is hard, accepting failure is harder, worse yet is choosing to surrender. Too often I find myself working too hard to just avoid failure, when avoiding or delaying the inevitable often exacerbates the problem(s) I'm facing. I don't want to fail because by definition the successful don't fail right? Surrendering is choosing to fail and accepting one's limitations. It is a choice to let go of pride, to accept that one is in a bad situation and cannot take even a single step more in that direction. 

Surrender is a term in Blackjack where you give up half your bet. It sounds like a bad deal but if you have a 16 vs a dealer's face you'll lose that hand 72% of the time. Surrendering actually saves you 22%. So failing to chose to fail makes one fail even more.

For me lately, we've been struggling with our rental property. It is quite emotional as it is the house I grew up in, a lot of bad memories reside there. We had turmoil when renting to family for a short period of time, then recently evicted the last tenant. We've been working very hard, time and money, to get the house ready to sell by July. I don't know if the house will be profitable or how much if it is. I know the ROI on my effort and emotion has been negative. There is a lot to be said about keeping things simple. My following post will be about [_Doubling Down_](www.bettingonsuccess.com/post/doubling-down/ "Doubling Down") since after _surrendering_ the things that are holing me down, I need to then take the energy I put in those unfruitful endeavors and put that into the ones that have brought me money, joy and benefit.

Protect yourself from _catastrophic_ failure, death, disability, fire, divorce etc. Then work on learning to handle the small issues, failure etc such as car repairs, home repairs, health cost (up to deductible / out-of-pocket max, hence insurance should cover the $1,000,000 and you the $6,000-$13,000). 

There is almost always an upside and a downside. In marketing and sales the downside is hidden. For example a credit card like might offer 100,000 points, airline perks, hotel perks etc to sign up and spend money. Now the upside is the points and other perks and the downside is the spending the money just to get them and the interest you pay IF you carry a balance. Now a true investor like Warren Buffet, focuses not on the upside, since it is almost always already there, but reducing the downside, "Don't lose money" he'd say. So if we _only_ spend money that is in our budget such has we had to buy new furniture or do a big business trip to begin with then that spending isn't a problem. We then pay the balance back (auto-pay is great) on time to pay no interest. We've now completely removed the downside (other than arguably credit cards lend to spending more but no one uses cash all the time anyways so debit cards are no different).

So find opportunities to succeed by reducing the cost of failure or the downside. 

The title of this blog _Betting On Success_ implies taking risk in order to succeed. I wanted to focus on success since by default most are too conservative. That said the blog's purpose is to teach _Balance_ of risk. Too often people come from Dave Ramsey's teachings and they thing debt is inherently evil and that credit cards are the devil. While this can work for some people to keep thing so dogmatic and black and white is what causes wars. There is balance.
