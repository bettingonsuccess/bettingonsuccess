Today I took my first step towards achieving my dreams, I quit my job. Quitting my job wasn't easy, especially a lucrative IT job. It was a very demanding position that ultimately was keeping me from being able to fully realize my dreams.

I was able to drop my job because I have a large amount saved and have multiple income streams producing cash flow that will give me time to ramp up the side hustle without having to worry about paying the bills. The timing worked out well since we'll also be traveling for medical tourism which will require a lot of time that I couldn't have taken off otherwise.

This blog will cover my journey as I go all-in on my dreams: pursuing my dream career as a professional gambler, using medical tourism to help us start a family and taking time to travel. There will be bumps along the way but I won't stop because I'm ALL-IN!
