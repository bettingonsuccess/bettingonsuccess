Today I took my first step towards achieving my dreams, I quit my job! This has been a plan of mine for a long time and I have multiple contingency plans (oh sh#! plans) in place. I am able to leave a high paying stable IT job because I have been saving a large percentage of my income regularly. This money gives me the ability to leave a bad situation or pursue a better one without having to worry about paying the bills. This money is affectionately called F.U. money by the personal finance community. It isn't enough money to never work again (Financial Independence) but I have multiple income streams producing cash flow that cover a good percentage of my expenses which will reduce the need to completely rely on my side-hustle for income.

The timing works out well since we'll also be traveling for medical tourism which will require a lot of time that I likely couldn't have taken off otherwise. We'll be able to take our time and really focus on what we need to do to start a family. 

For the first blog post the reader will have little background information to understand why I just up and quit a stable, high paying IT job. It may seem unwise, foolish and something only a crazy millennial would do (I am in my twenties after all). Although I didn't spend all that much time putting in my two-week notice, I did spend a lot of time planning what to do after those two weeks. I've actually been doing my side hustle professionally longer than I've been in my software career. I have a solid track record of making money. I've listed all of the risks and worse case scenarios that come with such a decision. I've taken action to reduce my downside and increase my upside potential. I've thought about important concepts that I've learned from my side hustle such as thinking long-term, pursuing positive E.V. situations and taking calculated risks (all terms I'll explain in later posts). 

Naturally after all the planning an calculation the most important task left is execution. Today I did that by submitting a two week notice. It'll be a crazy ride and there will be bumps along the way but I won't stop because I'm ALL-IN!
