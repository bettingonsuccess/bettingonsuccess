I hope by the post my audience will see that when the post title is simple a _term_ such as _Diversification_ is that it is because we need a solid understanding of the fundamental terms, concepts and goals before moving on; solid understanding of the fundamentals is half way to mastery. 

Since I enjoy professional gambling on the side let's do a casino example (pure gambling in this case). I take $ 1,000 to the casino (please, please don't do this) and think. "Hmm, should I just play Roulette? No, I should diversify because that's safer. I'll play Roulette, Poker, Craps and maybe some Blackjack". Of course this is clearly absurd but can you tell me _why?_ If you can't mathematically define why this is incorrect then read on.  I like to take things too far to get a better understanding of them.
