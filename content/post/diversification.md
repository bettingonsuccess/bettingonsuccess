I hope by the post my audience will see that when the post title is simple a _term_ such as _Diversification_ is that it is because we need a solid understanding of the fundamental terms, concepts and goals before moving on; solid understanding of the fundamentals is half way to mastery after all.

In order to demonstrate diversification (what it is NOT) let's do a casino example (pure gambling in this case). I take $ 1,000 to the casino (please, please don't do this) and think. "Hmm, should I just play Roulette? No, I should diversify because that's safer. I'll play Roulette, Poker, Craps and maybe some Blackjack". Of course this is clearly absurd but can you tell me _why?_ If you can't then read on (or see the post on [investing vs gambling](http://www.bettingonsuccess.com/post/investing-vs-gambling "Investing vs Gambling")).  I like to take things too far to get a better understanding of them.

Brace yourself for a basic statistics lesson. Statistics is the foundation of investing and in m opinion, life. Diversification is using statistics by trying to get closer to the actual E.V. sooner with less variation. Without diversification (in some cases this won't be true) in a simple example you'll make exactly the same amount of money. The only goal of diversification is again to get close to our Expected Value of our investment sooner which reduces our Risk of Ruin as well.

To bring the point home imagine rolling a die 6 times. On average each number 1-6 should show up once over those 6 rolls. If we kept track of the number that each number showed up it might look something like this: 5,3,1,2,6,5

4 happened 0/6

5 happened 2/6

and the rest 1/6 as expected.

What if we rolled that die 60 times, 600 times, 6 million times? We would see a smaller variation. This is the cone of uncertainty

![](/uploads/2018/08/30/cone_of_uncertainty.jpg)The more we repeatedly invest the closer we get to the average ROI or what professional gamblers like myself call Expected Value.

I'm on a bit of a tangent since diversification means to do different things, in this case multiple separate investments, again to reduce that cone of uncertainty, often at the cost of E.V. The most common example is stocks and bonds. They are separate and not directly correlated, in fact they are thought to be negatively correlated (stocks go up, bonds go down). Using bonds you'll have less variation but you'll also reduce your average return of your portfolio. In the investing world the correlation is called _Beta._ A Beta of 1.0 means they go up and down exactly the same.

> The more we repeatedly invest the closer we get to the average ROI...Expected Value

So back to the die example. We can reduce the cone of uncertainty by a. repeatedly rolling the die over time or b. rolling another die. If we roll another die then we get the same results as if we rolled 1 die 2 times, except imagine we roll 2 dice at the same time. Now we are getting that cone to converge more quickly with less time. We as investors have a finite timeline to invest. Our investing timeline really depends on our goals. One could be saving for college, down payment on a house, retirement or a vacation. Knowing your timeline lets you understand how much variation you can handle. I try to refrain from the work _risk_ is it is often poorly defined and poorly used, even by me.
