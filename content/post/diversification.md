I hope by the post my audience will see that when the post title is simple a _term_ such as _Diversification_ is that it is because we need a solid understanding of the fundamental terms, concepts and goals before moving on; solid understanding of the fundamentals is half way to mastery after all.

Since I enjoy professional gambling on the side let's do a casino example (pure gambling in this case). I take $ 1,000 to the casino (please, please don't do this) and think. "Hmm, should I just play Roulette? No, I should diversify because that's safer. I'll play Roulette, Poker, Craps and maybe some Blackjack". Of course this is clearly absurd but can you tell me _why?_ If you can't mathematically define why this is incorrect then read on.  I like to take things too far to get a better understanding of them.

Here is a chart (i.e. like Lending Club's Diversification chart)

Sorry for the statistics lesson again but that's all investing really is. Diversification is using  statistics but trying to get closer to the actual EV sooner with less variation. Without diversification (in some cases this won't be true) in a simple example you'll make exactly the same amount of money. The only goal of diversification is again to get close to our Expected Value of our investment sooner which reduces our Risk of Ruin and well as humans is nice. Plus an investor, country maybe, doesn't have 100 years to wait to have their profit (AV Actual Value) get close their EV.
