Risk is the intentional interaction with uncertainty. Humans by nature do not like uncertainty. We like to know how what to expect. This quote from Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is telling “Nobody panics when things go “according to plan”. Even if the plan is horrifying!”. So we love order even if it is bad events that are in order. 

So why is _Risk_ our _Friend_? 

Risk is the interaction with uncertainty and if we can handle even a little bit of uncertainty we can be certain we are doing the right thing. It sounds contradictory but for somethings one can know everything or almost everything that will happy. For instance, no matter how many times you roll a die you'll never get a cheeseburger. You'll always get 1-6, that's it. So there may be uncertainty yes but we can be certain that the outcome won't surprise us. For instance, we can invest in the stock market and understand there is risk of losing 50% of our portfolio at any given time. If we plan ahead then taking this risk isn't all that difficult.
