Risk is the intentional interaction with uncertainty. Humans by nature do not like uncertainty. We like to know how what to expect. This quote from Heath Ledger's portrail of the Joker is telling “Nobody panics when things go “according to plan”. Even if the plan is horrifying!”. So we love order even if it is bad events that are in order.
