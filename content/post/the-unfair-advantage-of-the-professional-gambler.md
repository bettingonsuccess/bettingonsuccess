#The Unfair Advantage of the Professional Gambler

I have moonlighted as a professional *gambler* for the last 4 years. I remember my new wife and I having very little money but had 1,500 in a white envelope. I would go to the casino and play poker and regularly come back with profit. Every time the envelope reached 2,000 we would pull out 500 as profit. I was making more money than my food job. It wasn't always easy money nor was is something easy to learn. It took constant practice and effort and for awhile it was more luck than skill until I truly understood the game and where my advantage came from. I even created computer simulations to understand specific situations for specific types of games.

Many people don't understand how I can make money at poker, but the ups and especially the downs is what gives me an unfair advantage towards life. I am use to losing 5,000 in the span of minutes sometimes. I'm use to people getting upset at me when it goes the other way and they lose 5,000 in minutes. So when it comes to investing in stock, like most of the FI/RE community, I laugh at their overly conservative and fearful minds. They are so afraid to lose that they guaranteed it by keeping 6 figures worth of cash on hand for a decade while the market goes up and up. This isn't *risk* as at all for them because *risk* means there is only a chance of failure, they have **GUARANTEED** their failure which is worst of all. The quote from Jill Wolf's poem titled *Don't Quit goes "For you're not a failure, until you fail to try" - Jill Wolf

I don't write this to brag but to show other INVESTORS (people) because we all invest, everyday and take risks everyday.
