I've noticed just how quickly life goes by. I'm now in my late twenties and before I know will hit the big 30 (for those older it seems big to me). I have a ton of goals to achieve before then. I have my eye on the horizon and am running as quickly as possible to get there. When one only looks at the horizon though, they never see the end and completely overlook where they are _now_. I've noticed my life goes so fast. In the month of February my wife and I were home 5 whole days out of 28. We flew out every weekend and the last trip was gone nearly 3 weeks. I love traveling and the business of life, I truly hate being bored.
