# Going All-In

Today I took my first step towards achieving my dreams, I quit my job. Quitting my job wasn't easy, especially a lucrative, flexible IT job. It was a very stressful, demanding position that ultimately was keeping me from being able to fully realize my dreams, which includes pursuing my side hustle as a full-time career.   
I was able to drop my job because I have a large amount saved and multiple income streams producing cash flow. I am not Financially Independent but I am pursuing FI. This blog will cover my journey as I go all-in on my dreams: pursuing my dream career, traveling and starting a family. There will be bumps along the way but I won't stop until I've attained the lifestyle that I want.
