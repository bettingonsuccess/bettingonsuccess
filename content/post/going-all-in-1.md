# Going All-In

I've been dreaming of having a lucrative and exciting career as a professional gambler since before I even started my career in software. In many ways it was a childish dream. I loved the casino environment, the thrill of winning, the freedom to play (work) whenever I wanted to and to travel all over doing it. Who wouldn't want that job? As I got into my white collar job I got paid very, very well. I still had this nagging feeling deep down that I wanted to try my dream. I'm well on my way to being Financially Independent at a _very_ early age (30's).

What does 'All-In' mean to you? It means giving 100% of your strength, emotion, effort, time,  wealth and most importantly, faith. When you are _All-In_ there is no turning back. You've proverbially (unless you're in a casino then literally) put all your chips in the circle.

What I aim to teach on this blog is a health understanding and respect for RISK. What is risk? According to Wikipedia ". . .the intentional interaction with uncertainty". I really, really like this definition. Too often in life we don't want to take risk aka have anything in our lives that is unpredictable. Hey me included. The thing is too often we overly focus on the negative and forget to weight it properly against the upside. The thing with risk is that there is a chance of both success and failure. When we chose the route of inaction or the 'easy' route we often are removing uncertainty but are, at the same time, unintentionally guaranteeing a less advantages outcome than if we had taken the risk and lost.

I am personally going ALL-IN on FIRE (Financial Independence / Retire Early). I have faith in FI and more importantly faith that even if I miss my goal that I will still be better off from this journey anyways.  I do everything for a reason. So what is my [Why of FI](https://www.choosefi.com/038-the-why-of-fi/ "Why of FI Podcast")?

My why is two fold.

1. Family
2. Travel

Everything else comes seconds to those those priorities.
