# Going All-In

Today I took my first step towards achieving my dreams, I quit my job. Quitting my job wasn't easy, especially a lucrative, flexible IT job. It was a very stressful, demanding position that ultimately was keeping me from being able to fully realize my dreams.  
I was able to drop my job because I have a large amount saved and have multiple income streams producing cash flow. The cash and cash flow cushion will give me time to ramp up my side hustle to a whole new level without having to worry about paying the bills. Ultimately my side hustle will get me to FI quicker but also get me to living a FI lifestyle more quickly.  
This blog will cover my journey as I go all-in on my dreams: pursuing my dream career as a professional gambler, using medical tourism to help my wife and I start a family via IVF and taking time to travel. There will be bumps along the way but I won't stop because I'm ALL-IN!
