A theme that I’m trying to wave throughout this blog is understanding risk. Risk is the act of intentionally interacting with uncertainty. My wife and I took risk in February by going to Mexico to get IVF done. Then in March we returned and have been anxiously waiting to see the results. We got a BFP (Big Fat Positive) as many say! 

Then March 29th we found out via Intra ultrasound that we weren’t just Pregnant (one die) but pregnant with Twins! 

Yes, with IVF we had 2 embryos transferred but even then the probability of getting pregnant at all is 15% at most so twins are still quite a surprise!
