Doubling Down is a move in Blackjack where you can double your original bet when you have a good hand so you can make even more money. I feel like this is a fitting post. In 2018, Mr and Mrs. BoS are Doubling Down on a some things while quitting others.

**Removing**

* Selling Fix and Flip that is currently rented
* Finishing 3+ year IT contract job
* Other investments etc

**Doubling Down**

* Business
* House Hacking (AirBnB'ing Basement)
* Stock (VTSAX anyone?)
* FI App Project
* Family / Travel

On the last point of Family. Mrs BoS and I found out that we are PREGNANT! Now it would only be fitting if we doubled down on the pregnancy so. . .we are pregnant with TWINS! (seriously). This is truly a blessing.

When one first starts out investing or even working they want to do _everything_ and that is a good thing. One can learn a little of everything though trying to do everything quickly becomes tiring. Eventually, one realizes some investments or activities are better than others. I use to say 'Yes' to every opportunity to make money. Now I know that I'm doing just fine and it is okay to say 'No, thanks' and to just enjoy life sometimes.

JL Collins would be proud as I'm moving to a simpler path to wealth; his book is titled  'simple path to wealth', one I highly recommend reading. One does not need to limit themselves to purely investing in stock . Adding real estate, side hustles or a business are all great approaches as well. I think when you're young do many different things (for stock definitely stick to being simple). Eventually of all the things you try, you'll find what you enjoy, what is lower stress, and what has the best ROI. Then you can cut away all the rest and _Double Down_ on those that do work.

One of the main parts to FI is helping someone find their WHY. I think of it like this.

Name the top 5 things you care about / enjoy doing. Pretend you have all the time in the world.

Mine are

1. Family (twins on the way)
2. Home a nice place for children to grow up and comfortable, plenty of things to do.
3. Travel, I want to visit different countries etc
4. Learning, I love learning new things
5. Martial Arts, I haven't ever had enough time or money to pursue this.

Now these are priorities meaning everything is weighed against these 5 things. If I decide to go out and buy a cup of coffee I need to ask "Is there a cheaper way? Will this make me $X happy? Is this costing me time / opportunity from my Top 5 list?". Now to many this would sound like a lot of work, constantly 'worrying' about pinching pennies. This isn't farther from the truth. Humans are creatures of habit and quickly one finds what is valuable and what isn't. For instance Mrs. BoS and I don't really have a budget since we tend to spend about the same amount of money over time. We hit our savings goals so the rest should be enjoyed. So at first YES, just like a diet or any new habit it requires being very conscious at first. Eventually though it becomes as subconscious as typing, or walking.

So the next time you are thinking about saying 'Yes' to something think about all the other things you are inherently saying 'No' to. Find the things that are the most valuable and double down on those.
