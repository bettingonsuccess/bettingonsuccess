Doubling Down is a move in Blackjack where you can double your original bet when you have a good hand so you can make even more money. I feel like this is a fitting post. In 2018, Mr and Mrs. BoS are Doubling Down on a few things and quitting others.

**Removing**

* Selling Fix and Flip that is currently rented
* Finishing 2+ year contract job
* Business Debt

**Doubling Down**

* Professional Gambling Business
* House Hacking (Long-Term rental in basement)
* Stock (VTSAX anyone? Nah my allocation is quite varied)
* Family / Travel

On the last point of Family. Mrs BoS and I found out that we are PREGNANT! Now it would only be fitting if we doubled down on the pregnancy so. . .we are pregnant with TWINS! This of course is a joke since we had no control on how many babies we'd have at once. This is truly a blessing. We were able to work hard to save $ and pursue FI before having a family and now within 8 months at age 27 we'll have 2 babies and our family will be complete.
