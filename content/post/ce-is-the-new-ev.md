Do you want a guaranteed $10 or 50% chance at $20? As we'ved discussed before the EV is % chance times amount so 50% of $20 = $10 EV which is equivalent to the guaranteed $10, but it isn't equivalent you say?

You are correct. The adjustment we need to make is based on risk. This has to do with your risk tolerance and preferences of course, that is what I call _soft math_. It isn't easily quantifiable nor universal like gravity.
