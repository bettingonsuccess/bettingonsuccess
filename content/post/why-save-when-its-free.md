\** **Warning** ** This will be controversial.

I am active in the personal finance community. I have fairly financially conservative and therefore tend to believe, or I did anyways, that if I make good choices, and work hard that I'd do better than most. I found out that being successful is punished and being less fortunate or poor can be an advantage. 

My wife and I couldn't get pregnant so we decided to do IVF. The frustration with infertility is that it can be $ 25,000 - $ 40,000 for just one round. Often 2-3 rounds are needed as well as weeks of time off work for the procedures. It hurts to see 16 year old girls get pregnant and have an abortion or give the baby up or others that can't even afford to have kids but welfare and WIC takes care of them. WIC will provide free food, formula, healthcare and housing for the mother and the child. I'm not saying having programs are inherently bad but contrast that with our situation where we make good money and yet can't get pregnant. We've been responsible, didn't get pregnant in high school, have careers, have a house etc. 

We make $ 97,000 / year. I know I'm RICH and PRIVILEDGES, right RIGHT?! 

That is ONLY  $5,200 / month ($62,400 annual take home) thanks to progressive takes. 

Our twin daughters were born 11 weeks prematurely under 3 pounds each. They need formula to help them grow. The formula costs $500 and is NOT covered by insurance for any reason. That $500 of formula will last about a week. That will be $2,000 / month in formula! 

My wife and I live VERY frugally. We have money saved and yet cannot afford this. 

If I made less than $ 45,000 per year we'd qualify for WIC. We'd get free health insurance $2,000+ / month in value plus no deductible at all, the girls' formula would be free, $ 2,000 / month in value. They'd provide free housing for my wife and the girls as well. Yet because I take home $20k more I get $50,000 LESS in assistance. I just lost $30,000 because I made the right decisions. 

My wife's grandmother Zoe is 94. At age 92 she moved to an assisted care facility. She had some money saved but gave most to charity in her life. When she liquidated her condo she had about $ 100,000 left over. She's on social security so that's all extra for her, right?! Well NO. The home costs $ 5,000 / month. So the home took her $ 100,000 until she was broke. After that it is free. So WHY did she save??? She just lost the money anyways. Often care centers will take their homes and all assets to pay the bills. Some try to transfer to children before but unless they're ex-military it has to be done more than 5 years beforehand which is hard to predict. 

My brother-in-law Jack has had a lot of struggles in life. He's made some poor choices as well. Often the family wishes he would get his life together. Last year, he had no income so the state gave him health insurance. He then self-diagnosed with an extremely rare disease that required brain surgery. It wasn't covered by normal health insurance. Since he was under the state it was 100% free. If he HAD his life together, had a house, $50k saved he would have LOST everything and gone bankrupt anyways. So he was better off NOT having his life together and NOT saving money.

We have a friend, Monica. She was an immigrant of adoption. She was able to get SSI for whatever reason. She recieves the standard $720 / month and can get section 5 income based housing. Her rent is $80 / month for a VERY nice 1 bedroom apartment. She gets EBT for food and of course free health care. 

My wife and I encourage Monica to get a job and do better for herself, because she was completely capable of working. Monica agreed and got a job at a nursing home as a CNA, she had worked on her certification. She was making $15 / hour and working a lot of overtime. She was grossing around $ 3,000 / month but about $ 2,400 after taxes. Her rent, based on income, went up to $1,000 per month and she then was going to lose her free healthcare and EBT. At that time there was no ACA so she couldn't get healthcare through an exchange or employer. Even now ACA would be too expensive for little coverage. She was working 60 hours per week and NO better off than when she wasn't working at all. Monica quit her job and returned to taking SSI. My wife and I were disappointed but at the same time didn't blame her. If the government paid for me to NOT work then why would I either?

I've well versed in most areas of personal finance, at least what pertains to me. Many, especially in the US, need to be saving a lot more $ instead of constantly going into debt to get a car that costs more than their annual salary or the newest IPhone that costs more than their monthly salary.

For those of us that save and are responsible with money, we may ask why others don't save when a $500 emergency could end them? Well a part of it is that in America if you don't have money, then it is FREE. This may come as controversial and a bit political. I apologize but it needs to be said.

\-- If you don't have $ for children there is WIC

\-- If you don't have money for nursing home it is FREE. If you have money they'll take it (your home, assets etc) until you are broke. So having $50k saved is punished and having $0 saved is not.

\-- Plenty live off of welfare and social security. I've seen people get $3,000-$8,000 / month in benefits. Free housing, free food from foodshelf, free healthcare, free daycare, free transportation, free schooling etc. Even if they get a job why would they? Their $150 rent would go up to $1200 (like the rest of us pay) AND they'd have to actually, um, work.

\-- Bankruptcy. I know of people who go bankrupt every 7 years like clockwork. They spend more than they can earn and when it is too much their debts get wiped away. I have a family member that did 10's of $1,000's of dollars of work as a contractor to a home. The owner ended up going bankrupt. In bankruptcy, chapter 7, all your debts are wiped away and you can keep 1 car and your house. So they kept the house, with all the work they did and paid them nothing! It was legal robbery, because they couldn't 'afford' the debt they incurred buying more than they could afford (again people do go bankrupt due to sad and horrible reasons like medical bills. A reason to be well insured and another point that we need to fix our healthcare / insurance in the US already).

\-- Force Family. In some states parents can force their children to take care of them in old age. It sounds like in most places this isn't enforced as much but still something that is completely unfair that can happen.

\-- Spousal support. This loophole I believe is getting fixed. Imagine a couple divorces and the man was the main breadwinner (this is common and not sexist.). The woman would get spousal maintenance to help her until she remarries or possibly forever. If she co-habitates but doesn't remarry. She can suck off of her ex-husband forever. Plus she can collect her new husband or ex-husband's social security at retirement.

There are so many cases in the US that you can just live off of charity, the government or other people's kindness. I've tried to help many people myself but have always gotten burned. Often I hear that from very religious people that 'God' will provide, more often than not it is the 'Gov' that provides and not 'God', one little letter they missed. Some lady spent all hear money on lottery tickets and lost so she started a GoFundMe to help her. This is an extreme example but shows it.

So for those saving to retire comfortably or even early why worry about running out? If you run out there will always be someone who is working hard to pay taxes that will support you.

So to all those in the FIRE community with $ 5,000,000 in assets when they are going into the nursing home, thanks. All that money will be taken and ultimately pay for me to be there for free. 

So I ask one more time.   
WHY SAVE?

IT'S FREE.
