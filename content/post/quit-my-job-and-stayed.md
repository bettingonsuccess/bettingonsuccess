My first post was about going ALL-IN and taking risks to achieve my dreams. Naturally, I assumed that meant going extreme and quitting my job, which I did the day of that post. What followed was quite unexpected; my job wouldn't 'let' me quit. Obviously they couldn't literally keep me from quitting but they did everything that could to keep me from doing so. Frankly, I was shocked. I really do like the company and the direction they are going in but was, naturally, excited to pursue my crazy hobby as a professional. I had made a full-time professional friend in the business who was helping me as well.

I sent an email indicating my requests that I would need fulfilled in order to stay. It was a good time to ask for the moon and see what they said even if I stayed or not. As I waited for their reply I contemplated why decision and what I truly wanted and needed.  A part of me was dead set on going full-time. This is what I have wanted so badly and for so long after all. Another part of me realized that I truly did love my software career for the most part and my side hustle doesn't take up a lot of time though it requires a good amount of travel. If they'd be flexible with me then I could possibly do both, I wasn't sure I wanted to do both.

Then a few days later they replied and agreed to fulfill all my requests if I stayed. I discussed the decision with my wife to keep BOTH of my loves: software and investing. 

This is the best decision I could have made but it wasn't all about the money. Mrs. BoS and I haven't achieved FI yet and going full-time may have gotten us their quicker or maybe it would have taken us a longer. The main thing is that we had the power to chose. I chose to stay because I enjoyed the work, I am still able to pursue my side-hustle (which I'll do full-time in FI) and the guaranteed salary from my career will guarantee we reach FI by our early 30's. I don't have a problem taking calculated risks but one always needs to weight the reward for taking the risk and the reward for taking none. In the case of my software job I get paid a guaranteed large salary.
