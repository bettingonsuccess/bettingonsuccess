Although this is _BettingOnSuccess_, so you would think I am focusing on the success (I am) but I also give due weight (but no more) to failures. So you say with a 4% Safe Withdrawal rate you have a 90% success rate (90% chance of never running out of money) I would say you have a 10% Risk of Ruin.
