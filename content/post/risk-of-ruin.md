This blog is titled _BettingOnSuccess_, so you might  think I am focusing on the success, which I am. I focus on success because humans are naturally [overly risk adverse](https://hbr.org/2013/07/hidden-danger-of-being-risk-averse "hidden danger of being risk averse"). That said, I also give due weight (but no more mind you) to failures and risk. 

> **Risk aversion**Â is a preference for a sure outcome over a gamble with higher or equal expected value. -Wikipedia

I am personally saving a large portion of my income in order to reach Financial Independence and possibly retire (my choice) earlier than retirement age. Even if you are not, you still likely want to retire someday. Retirement calculators often say you need 10x your highest income plus social security, or somewhere between $5-$10,000,000 in order to retire. Their ridiculous numbers will likely turn you off (they did me) from even trying to save enough for retirement. It feels hopeless.

There was a study done called the [Trinity Study](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadepfau/2018/01/16/the-trinity-study-and-portfolio-success-rates-updated-to-2018/#5d31aa3b6860 "Trinity Study updated 2018") that looked at retirement investments and to try to figure out a Safe Withdrawal rate that had a high success rate. The common 4% rules comes from this study. If one withdrew 4% of their portfolio every year adjusting for inflation.
