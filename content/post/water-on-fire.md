# WATER on FI/RE

As we all know in the FIRE community, FI/RE stands for Financial Independence / Retire Early. Well I want to introduce a new acronym WATER. 

— Wealth

— Actualization

— Time

— Energy

— Relationships

## Wealth

Money. This is the main focus of the FI community as its our greatest tool that we use to buy the rest.

## (Self)-Actualization

Like Maslows hierarchy of needs or MadFientist’s FI hierarchy. We find what makes us truly happy and we dind that place that makes us content. We have enough. 

## Time

The most limited and valuable resource. This is what we spend our wealth on, to buy time. 

## Energy

Health. We need to be healthy. Skinny waist, fat wallet. Without Energy and health the rest dont matter. 

## Relationships

Family. Friends. Community. We all need important people in our lives. One of the most enjoyable parts of FIRE (or should I say WATER now?) path is the vibrant, open, and tight community. We are all so differently politically, geographically, linguistically, etc and yet we all agree we can be free. 

So yes I guess this is still a FI/RE blog but hey next time you’re trying to explain what you are doing put some WATER in the conversation.
