As we all know in the FIRE community, FI/RE stands for Financial Independence / Retire Early. Well I want to be so bold as to attempt to introduce a new acronym into our FIRE vocabulary, WATER. 

I titled this post Greek FIRE since Greek Fire was a weapon of fire that was able to burn while floating on water. I feel this well illustrates how the concept FIRE floats on the concept of WATER.

So what is W.A.T.E.R?

**W**ealth **A**ctualization **T**ime **E**nergy **R**elationships

## Wealth

Money. This is the main focus of the FI community as its our greatest tool that we use to buy the rest.

## Actualization

Action. Execution. Realization. Self-Actualization. Like Maslow's hierarchy of needs or MadFientist’s FI hierarchy. We find what makes us truly happy and we find a place of where we are content and at peace. We have enough Time, Energy (Health), Wealth, and Love. So we strive to attain personal growth and to give out of our surplus.

## Time

The most limited and valuable resource. This is what we spend our wealth on, to buy time. Without time we cannot do anything.

## Energy

Health. We need to be healthy. Skinny waist, fat wallet. Without Energy and health the rest don't matter.

## Relationships

Family. Friends. Community. We all need important people in our lives. One of the most enjoyable parts of FIRE (or should I say WATER now?) path is the vibrant, open, and tight community. We are all so differently politically, geographically, linguistically, etc and yet we all agree we can be free.

So yes I guess this is still a FI/RE blog but hey next time you’re trying to explain what you are doing put some WATER in the conversation. The concepts of WATER are what hold the FIRE up to burn. This is why FIRE + WATER = Greek FIRE or in our case Financial Greek FIRE.
