As we all know in the FIRE community, FI/RE stands for Financial Independence / Retire Early. Well I want to be so bold as to attempt to introduce a new acronym into our FIRE vocabulary, WATER.

So what is W.A.T.E.R?

**W**ealth **A**ctualization **T**ime **E**nergy **R**elationships

## Wealth

Money. This is the main focus of the FI community as its a powerful tool that we use to buy the rest. We need roughly 25X our annual spending to be financially independent. Now one doesn't need to reach 25X (Full FI) to start working down the list of WATER.

## Actualization

Action. Execution. Realization. Self-Actualization. Like Maslow's hierarchy of needs or MadFientist’s FI hierarchy. We find what makes us truly happy and we find a place of where we are content and at peace. Quickly as we improve our savings rate, normalize our budget we get freedom, that may include taking a better but lower pay job, going part-time or taking multiple sabbaticals. Actualization is when we've made our dreams real, more importantly we've identified what they are.

## Time

The most limited and valuable resource. This is what we spend our wealth on, to buy time. Without time we cannot do anything. We need TIME to save money, TIME to actualize our dreams as well as to find self-actualization.

## Energy

Health. We need to be healthy. Skinny waist, fat wallet. Without Energy and health the rest don't matter. Once we have more TIME we can work harder on pursuing a healthier lifestyle. We can take time to bike places, even if it takes longer.

## Relationships

Family. Friends. Community. We all need important people in our lives. One of the most enjoyable parts of FIRE journey (or should I say WATER now?) path is the vibrant, open, and tight community. We are all so differently politically, geographically, linguistically, etc and yet we all agree we can be free.

So yes I guess this is still a FI/RE blog but hey next time you’re trying to explain what you are doing put some WATER in the conversation.
