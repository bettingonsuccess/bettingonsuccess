As we all know in the FIRE community, FI/RE stands for Financial Independence / Retire Early. I want to be so bold as to attempt to introduce a new acronym into our FIRE vocabulary, WATER.

Putting WATER on FIRE might sound contradictory but I find water is much softer and stronger. Water can create rivers and rock formations over long time period. While FIRE is much more intense, burning quickly which I think turns a lot of people off.

Without further adue what is W.A.T.E.R?

## Wealth

Money. This is the main focus of the FI community as its a powerful tool that we use to buy the rest. We need roughly 25X our annual spending to be financially independent. Now one doesn't need to reach 25X (Full FI) to start working down the list of WATER.

## Actualization

Action. Execution. Realization. Self-Actualization. Like Maslow's hierarchy of needs we need to find what makes us truly happy. We need to find a place of where we are content and at peace. As one increases their savings rate, pay down debt, they quickly gain freedom. This freedom allows one that may include taking a better but lower pay job, going part-time or taking multiple sabbaticals. Eventually achieving full FI will give even more time to actualize one's dreams daily.

## Time

The most limited and valuable resource. We don't know how much time we have, only a good guess. This is what we spend our wealth on, to buy time. Without time we cannot do anything. We need TIME to save money, TIME to attain self-actualization and TIME to enjoy life.

## Energy

Energy comes from the body. A healthy body has more energy. Health is extremely important. Without health the rest of our resources matter very little. Once we have more TIME we can work harder on pursuing a healthier lifestyle. We can take time to bike places, even if it takes longer.

## Relationships

Family. Friends. Community. We all have important relationships in our lives. Having the wealth, time and energy allows us to deepen our relationships and reach out to make new ones. One of the most enjoyable parts to the FIRE journey is the vibrant, open and welcoming community behind it.

So that's WATER. A simple acronym I remember to keep me focused on what is most important, and it isn't the money.
